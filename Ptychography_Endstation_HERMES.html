        <li>vibration from the chiller messed up reconstruction
          got better when longer pipes were used for water.</li>
        <li> OSA gap, slits, exposure time do not influence the quality of the
          image</li>
        <li>Need better camera fixation to reduce vibration</li>
        <li>Results from SHARP was not reproducile, the images looked different
        upon each reonstruction</li>

      Gave permalloy nanorods CXI file to plot XMCD images, took longer time to converge.
      We found that the new images taken during November 2019 beamtime was binned times 6.
      Therefore, it resulted in the distance between the detector and object longer than
      the magnetosome file where the distance between the same and detector was consistent
      with the experiment. For the next step we decided to use the raw data i.e. the
      .nxs file or the list of .tiff files.</li>
      <li> Things that are needed in the CXI/nxs file - a new format for PyNx are the following </li>
        <ol>
          <li>step size:</li>
          <li>distance between sample and camera:</li>
          <li>Energy:</li>
          <li>diameter of the beam:</li>
          <li>pixel size of the camera:</li>
        </ol>
      <li> Kadda asked for old cxi file with lots of Tiff images, copying the images took long time
        therefore could not give to him.</li>
