# Generic help text, to be completed with beamline/instrument-specific help text

helptext_generic = """
generic (not beamline-specific) command-line arguments: (all keywords are case-insensitive)
    scan=56: scan number (e.g. in specfile) [mandatory, unless cxifile is used as input].
             Alternatively a list or range of scans can be given:
                scan=12,23,45 or scan="range(12,25)" (note the necessary quotes when using range)

    maxframe=128: limit the total number of frames used to the first N
                  [default=None, all frames are used]

    maxsize=256: the frames are automatically cropped to the largest possible size while keeping 
                 the center of gravity of diffraction in the frame center. Use this to limit the 
                 maximum frame size, for tests or limiting memory use [default=512]

    moduloframe=n1,n2: instead of using all sequential frames of the scan, only take one in n1.
                       if n2"<"n1 is also given, then the frame numbers taken will be the n for which
                       n % n1 == n2. This can be used to perform two reconstructions with half of 
                       the frames, and then analyse the resolution using Fourier ring correlation.
                       If both moduloframe and maxframe are given, the total number of frames taken 
                       is still maxframe.
                       [default: take all frames]

    algorithm=ML**50,DM**100,probe=1: algorithm for the optimization: [default='ML**50,DM**100']
    
        The algorithm used is:
        - divided in 'steps' separated by commas, e.g: ML**50,DM**100
        - interpreted from right to left, as a mathematical operator to an object on the 
          right-hand side
        - should not contain any space, unless it is given between quotes ('')
        
        - the first type of commands can change basic parameters or perform some analysis:
          - probe=1 or 0: activate or deactivate the probe optimisation (by default only the 
            object is optimised)
          - object=1 or 0: activate or deactivate the object optimisation
          - background=1 or 0: activate or deactivate the background optimisation 
            (only works with AP)
          - nbprobe=3: change the number of modes for the probe (can go up or down)
          - regularization=1e-4: setting the regularization parameter for the object, to penalize 
                                 local variations in ML runs and smooth the solution
          - obj_smooth=1.5 or probe_smooth=1.0: these parameters will partially smooth the object and probe inertia,
            softening the resulting arrays. This applies to DM and AP algorithms.
          - obj_inertia=0.01 or obj_probe=0.001: these parameters set the inertia of the object and/or probe update,
            yielding more stable result. This applies to DM and AP algorithms.
          - ortho: will perform orthogonalisation of the probe modes. The modes are sorted by 
            decreasing intensity.
          - analysis: perform an analysis of the probe (propagation, modes). Useful combined 
            with 'saveplot' to save the analysis plots
        
        - the second type are operators which will be applied to the Ptycho object:
          - AP: alternate projections. Slow but converging algorithm
          - DM: difference map. Fast early convergence, oscillating after.
          - ML: maximum likelihood conjugate gradient (Poisson-noise). Robust, converging,
            for final optimization.
          These operators can be combined mathematically, e.g.:
          - DM**100: corresponds to 100 cycles of difference map
          - ML**40*DM**100: 100 cycles of DM followed by 40 cycles of ML (note the order)


        Example algorithms chains:
          - algorithm=ML**40,DM**100,probe=1: activate probe optimisation, 
            then 100 DM and 40 ML (quick)
          - algorithm=ML**100,DM**200,nbprobe=3,ML**40,DM**100,probe=1,DM**100: first DM with 
            object update only,  then 100 DM also updating the probe, then use 3 probe modes 
            and do 100 DM followed by 40 ML
          - algorithm=ML**100*AP**200*DM**200,probe=1: 200 DM then 200 AP then 100 ML (one step)
          - algorithm='(ML**10*DM**20)**5,probe=1': 
            repeat 5 times [20 cycles of DM followed by 5 cycles of ML]
            (note the quotes necessary for the parenthesis)

    nbrun=10: number of optimizations to perform [default=1]

    run0=10: number for the first run (can be used to overwrite previous run results) 
             [default: after previous results or 1]

    liveplot: liveplot during optimization [default: no display]

    saveplot: will save plot at the end of the optimization (png file) [default= not saved].
              Optionally this can also specify if only the object phase should be plotted, e.g.:
              saveplot=object_phase: will display the object phase
              saveplot=object_rgba: will use RGBA to display both amplitude and phase.

    saveprefix=ResultsScan%04d/Run%04d: prefix to save the optimized object and probe 
              (as a .cxi or .npz file) and optionally image (png) [default='ResultsScan%04d/Run%04d']

    output_format='cxi': choose the output format for the final object and support.
                         Possible choices: 'cxi', 'npz'
                         [Default='cxi']

    save=all: either 'final' or 'all' this keyword will activate saving after each optimization 
              step (ptycho, ML) of the algorithm in any given run [default=final]

    load=Results0057/Run0001.cxi (or .npz): load object and probe from previous optimization. Note that the
               object and probe will be scaled if the number of pixels is different for the probe.
              [default: start from a random object, simulate probe]


    loadprobe=Results0057/Run0001.npz (or .cxi): load only probe from previous optimization 
                                       [default: simulate probe]

    loadpixelsize=8.6e-9: specify the pixel size (in meters) from a loaded probe 
                          (and possibly object). If the pixel size is different,
                          the loaded arrays will be scaled to match the new pixel size.
                          [default: when loading previous files, object/probe pixel size is 
                          calculated from the size of the probe array, assuming same detector 
                          distance and pixel size]

    probe=focus,60e-6x200e-6,0.09: define the starting probe, either using:
                                  focus,60e-6x200e-6,0.09: slits size (horizontal x vertical),
                                                           focal distance (all in meters)
                                  focus,200e-6,0.09: radius of the circular aperture, 
                                                     focal distance (all in meters)
                                  gaussian,100e-9x200e-9: gaussian type with horizontal x vertical
                                                          FWHM, both given in meters
                                  disc,100e-9: disc-shape, with diameter given in meters
                                  [mandatory, ignored if 'load' or 'loadprobe' is used]

    defocus=1e-6: defocused position (+: towards detector). The probe is propagated by this distance
                  before being used. This is true both for calculated probes (using 'probe=...') 
                  and for probes loaded from a previous file.

    rotate=30: rotate the probe (either simulated or loaded) by X degrees [default: no rotation]

    object=random,0.9,1,0,6: specify the original object values. The object will be initialised
                             over the entire area using random values: random,0-1,0-6.28 : random 
                             amplitudes between 0 and 1, random phases between 0 and 6.28.
                             For high energy small-angle ptycho (i.e. high transmission), 
                             recommended value is: random,0.9,1,0,0
                             [default: random,0,1,0,6.28]

    verbose=20: print evolution of llk (and display plot if 'liveplot' is set) every N cycle 
                [default=50]

    data2cxi: if set, the raw data will be saved in CXI format (http://cxidb.org/cxi.html), 
              will all the required information for a ptychography experiment (energy, detector 
              distance, scan number, translation axis are all required). if 'data2cxi=crop' 
              is used, the data will be saved after centering and cropping (default is to save 
              the raw data). If this keyword is present, the processing stops after exporting the data.

    mask= or loadmask=mask.npy: the mask to be used for detector data, which should have the same 2D
                       shape as the raw detector data.
                       This should be a boolean or integer array with good pixels=0 and bad ones>0
                       (values are expected to follow the CXI convention)
                       Acceptable formats:
                       - mask.npy, mask.npz (the first data array will be used)
                       - mask.edf or mask.edf.gz (a single 2D array is expected)
                       - "mask.h5:/entry_1/path/to/mask" hdf5 format with the full path to the 
                         2D array. 'hdf5' is also accepted as extension.
                       - 'maxipix': if this special name is entered, the masked pixels will be rows 
                         and columns multiples of 258+/-3

    roi=xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax: the region-of-interest to be used for actual inversion. The area is taken 
                             with python conventions, i.e. pixels with indices xmin<= x "<"xmax and 
                             ymin"<"= y "<" ymax.
                             Additionally, the shape of the area must be square, and 
                             n=xmax-xmin=ymax-ymin must also be a suitable integer number
                             for OpenCL or CUDA FFT, i.e. it must be a multiple of 2 and the largest number in
                             its prime factor decomposition must be less or equal to the largest value
                             acceptable by clFFT (<=13 as of November 2016) or cuFFT (<=7).
                             If n does not fulfill these constraints,
                             it will be reduced using the largest possible integer smaller than n.
                             This option supersedes 'maxsize' unless roi='auto'.
                             Other possible values:
                             - 'auto': automatically selects the roi from the center of mass 
                                       and the maximum possible size. [default]
                             - 'all' or 'full': use the entire, uncentered frames. Only useful for pre-processed
                                      data. Cropping may still be performed to get a square and 
                                      FFT-friendly size.

    rebin=2: the experimental images can be rebinned (i.e. a group of n x n pixels is replaced by a
             single one whose intensity is equal to the sum of all the pixels). This 'rebin' is 
             performed last: the ROI, mask, background, pixel size should all correspond to 
             full (non-rebinned) frames. 
             [default: no rebin]

    autocenter=0: by default, the object and probe are re-centered automatically after each 
                  optimisation step, to avoid drifts. This can be used to deactivate this behaviour
                  [default=True]
    
    center_probe_n, center_probe_max_shift: during DM, the probe can shift. The probe center of mass  will be checked
                                            every center_probe_n cycles, and the object and probe position will be
                                            corrected if the center deviates by more than center_probe_max_shift pixels.
                                            This is ignored for near field ptycho.
                                            [default: center_probe_n=5, center_probe_max_shift=5]
    
    dm_loop_obj_probe=3: during DM, when both object and probe are updated, it can be more stable to loop the object
                         and probe update for a more stable optimisation, but slower. [default: 2]
                  
    detector_orientation=1,0,0: three flags which, if True, will do in this order: 
                                array transpose (x/y exchange), flipud, fliplr [default: no change]
                                The changes also apply to the mask.
    
    xy=y,x: order and expression to be used for the XY positions (e.g. '-x,y',...). Mathematical 
            operations can also be used, e.g.: xy=0.5*x+0.732*y,0.732*x-0.5*y
            [default: None- may be superseded in some scripts e.g. for ptypy]
    
    flatfield=flat.npy: the flatfield correction to be applied to the detector data. The array must
                        have the same shape as the frames, which will be multiplied by this 
                        correction.
                        Acceptable formats:
                        - flat.npy, flat.npz (the first data array will be used)
                        - flat.edf or flat.edf.gz (a single 2D array is expected)
                        - "flat.h5:/entry_1/path/to/flat" hdf5 format with the full path to the 
                          2D array. 'hdf5' is also accepted as extension.
                        - flat.mat: from a matlab file. The first array found is loaded
                       [default: no flatfield correction is applied]
    
    dark=dark.npy: the dark correction to be subtracted from the detector data. The array must have 
                       the same shape as the frames, which will be substracted by this correction.
                       Acceptable formats:
                       - dark.npy, dark.npz (the first data array will be used)
                       - dark.edf or dark.edf.gz (a single 2D array is expected)
                       - "dark.h5:/entry_1/path/to/dark" hdf5 format with the full path to the 
                         2D array. 'hdf5' is also accepted as extension.
                       - dark.mat: from a matlab file. The first array found is loaded
                       [default: no dark correction is applied]
    
    orientation_round_robin: will test all possible combinations of xy and detector_orientation 
                             to find the correct detector configuration.
