<h1> Expert user Manual : Pre-Processing code + pynx reconstruction</h1>
<h2> Pre process file</h2>


The preprocessing files are located in "/home/experiences/hermes/com-hermes/pynx_HERMES/pynx_v1/Pre_Processing".  
There are three main python codes which perform the pre processing for the pynx reconstruction. The three pynx scripts are the following (the files will be renamed better once we have a good work flow):
  <ol>
    <li> Very_Simple_preprocess_NXS.py - Will be often used</li>
    <li> Very_simple_preprocess_NXS_v1.py - Probably never be used</li>
    <li> Select_nxs_files.py - Will be used when a large number of files need to be preprocessed for exmaple for ptycho spectra measurements<li>
  </ol>
All these scripts can be executed from a common bash file "bash_filie_preprocessing.sh" depending on the user needs. In the bash file the user can also give in instructions to perform pynx reconstruction once the pre processing is over and the users can define list of files to pre-process and reconstruct. 
   
<b>STEP 1:</b> There are three files that are generated during the ptychography data acquisition, make sure you have all the three. All these files are stored in the same folder as defined by the user during the beamtime..
 <br>
<ol>
<li> siNumber_date_000001.nxs - with images of all the diffraction pattern (indicated in figure 1, where the red boxes are the region in the sample where diffraction pattern is imaged in the camera </li>
<li> siNumber_date_dark_000001.nxs - with images acquired without the X-rays </li>
<li> Sample_Image_data_filename.hdf5 - contains the X and Y coordinates corresponding to the diffraction pattern.(refer figure 1)</li>
</ol><br>

<b> STEP 2: Configure the bash file</b><br>
The bash script has the necessary text and locations to put the necessary parameters, when entered appropriately there will be no errors. Please pay attention to the spaces!!
