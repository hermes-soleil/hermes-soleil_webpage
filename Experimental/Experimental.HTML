  <h1> Experimental setup</h1>
The control schematic of the ptychography set up is shown in below(Fig.1). A PyTango script is written to control<br>
 (1) the camera <br>
 (2)Pixellator software <br>
 (3) beamline parameters <br>
 The acquisition of the image by the camera is initiated by the trigger from the pixellator software.

  <h3> Converting STXM to ptychography configuration</h3>
  
 <ol>
   <li> Replacing the PMT with Camera: <br>
     Carefully unmount the PMT wrap it with Al foil and safely keep it inside the STXM chamber itself. Make sure that it is placed on a safe place that it does not interfere in the Z-translation of the stage.</li>
   <li> Install the camera:<br>
     Remove the glass cover off the chip and place the Ti cone. If the chip size is different make sure that the cone is in place by sticking some capton tapes. Install the camera inside the chamber using a rectangular Al plate on the translation stage. Make sure that the camera is placed approximately 6.5 cm from the sample. Please refer to this of the images during the first run for references<a href ="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1x37jNQ-Eb3BKro4_P4jLChdZjIbWBlStZfpn3vEz_7E/edit#slide=id.g5852d9c8c9_7_8"> Link </a></li>
   <li> Connect all the wires:<br>
     This includes a power chord, trigger. The trigger connection have two sma connectors, use the one with a elbow sma.
