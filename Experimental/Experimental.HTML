  <h1> Experimental setup</h1>
The control schematic of the ptychography set up is shown in below(Fig.1). A PyTango script is written to control<br>
 (1) the camera <br>
 (2)Pixellator software <br>
 (3) beamline parameters <br>
 The acquisition of the image by the camera is initiated by the trigger from the pixellator software.

  <h3> Converting STXM to ptychography configuration</h3>
  
 <ol>
   <li> Replacing the PMT with Camera: <br>
     Carefully unmount the PMT wrap it with Al foil and safely keep it inside the STXM chamber itself. Make sure that it is placed on a safe place that it does not interfere in the Z-translation of the stage.</li>
   <li> Install the camera:<br>
     Remove the glass cover off the chip and place the Ti cone. If the chip size is different make sure that the cone is in place by sticking some capton tapes.
